# HYPCNet: A Hybrid Yoga Pose Classification Neural Network

This project aims to be create a benchmark on classification yoga poses using pure Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) and without using any specialized techniques. This is achieved by using a novel idea of using ConvNext as a backbon to extract metafeatures from images and using conventional classifying machine learning techniques to correcty predict yoga poses with higher accuracy.
